# Tech Store

A full-stack bilingual (EN/AR) e-commerce platform built to demonstrate production-grade full-stack architecture: authentication & RBAC, cart/wishlist, checkout with atomic stock handling, a payment/shipment state machine, verified-purchase reviews, product image galleries, a homepage slider, and a full admin dashboard.

## Features

- **Catalog** — categories (with hierarchy), brands, products with option/value/variant support (e.g. size × color)
- **Product Images** — admin-managed gallery per product (`/admin/products/[id]/edit`): upload via Cloudinary, reorder, set primary, delete — first image auto-promotes to primary, and deleting the primary auto-promotes the next one, since storefront cards/cart/wishlist only ever query the primary image
- **Storefront gallery** — product detail page shows the primary image large with a clickable thumbnail strip for the rest
- **Homepage Slider** — admin-managed image carousel (`/admin/sliders`): each slide has an optional link (internal path or external URL); a slide with no link renders as a plain, non-clickable image. Responsive crossfade carousel, auto-advances every 5s, pauses on hover/focus
- **Auth & RBAC** — Google OAuth + email/password, JWT sessions, admin-only routes enforced in `proxy.ts` (Next.js 16's middleware convention)
- **Cart & Wishlist** — IDOR-protected, optimistic UI updates
- **Checkout** — atomic stock decrement via Prisma transactions, coupon validation, live Bosta-backed shipping cost (see Shipping section)
- **Orders** — payment/shipment state machine with guarded transitions (`canTransitionOrder`, `canTransitionPayment`, `canTransitionShipment`)
- **Reviews** — five-condition verified-purchase check before a review is allowed
- **Admin dashboard** — full CRUD for products (incl. images), categories, brands, options, values, variants, shipping rates, and the homepage slider

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A PostgreSQL database (local, or a free instance on [Neon](https://neon.tech) / [Supabase](https://supabase.com))
- A Google Cloud OAuth Client (for Google sign-in)

## Local Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Create your env file (see table below) then fill in the values
cp .env.example .env
# On Windows PowerShell, use: Copy-Item .env.example .env

# 3. Generate the Prisma client (required — app/generated/prisma is gitignored)
npx prisma generate

# 4. Run migrations against your database
npx prisma migrate dev

# 5. Seed demo data (optional but recommended)
npx prisma db seed

# 6. Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

App runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

> **Windows note:** if you ever recreate folders with bracket names (e.g. `[id]`), use `New-Item -ItemType Directory -LiteralPath "app\api\products\[id]"` — plain PowerShell paths misinterpret `[id]` as a wildcard.

An up-to-date `.env.example` with all of the above (verified against actual `process.env.*` references in the code, not just this table) lives in the project root.

Generate `AUTH_SECRET` (works the same in PowerShell, bash, or macOS):

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
```

For Google OAuth, set the authorized redirect URI in Google Cloud Console to:

- Local: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
- Production: `https://<your-domain>/api/auth/callback/google`

## Deploying to the Cloud (Neon + Vercel)

**One-time prep — before your first deploy:**

Add a `postinstall` hook so Vercel regenerates the Prisma client on every build (Vercel doesn't know to run this otherwise) — **this is not yet added to `package.json` as of this writing, add it before deploying**:

```jsonc
// package.json
"scripts": {
  "postinstall": "prisma generate",
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start",
  "lint": "eslint"
}
```

**1. Create the database (Neon)**

```bash
# Install Neon's CLI (one-time)
npm install -g neonctl

# Log in and create a project
neonctl auth
neonctl projects create --name tech-store

# Get the pooled connection string (use this one for serverless — it goes through PgBouncer)
neonctl connection-string --pooled
```

> Prefer the web UI? Create a project at [console.neon.tech](https://console.neon.tech), then copy the **pooled** connection string — Vercel's serverless functions open many short-lived connections, and the pooled endpoint avoids exhausting Postgres's connection limit. (Supabase works the same way: use its "Transaction" pooler connection string, port `6543`.)

**2. Apply your schema to the cloud database**

```bash
# macOS/Linux — point at the cloud DB for this one command
DATABASE_URL="<your-neon-pooled-url>" npx prisma migrate deploy

# Windows PowerShell
$env:DATABASE_URL="<your-neon-pooled-url>"; npx prisma migrate deploy

# Optional: seed demo data into the cloud DB too (PowerShell)
$env:DATABASE_URL="<your-neon-pooled-url>"; npx prisma db seed
```

**3. Deploy to Vercel**

```bash
npm install -g vercel

vercel login
vercel link          # links this folder to a Vercel project

# Add each env var (repeat for every variable in the table above)
vercel env add DATABASE_URL production
vercel env add AUTH_SECRET production
vercel env add AUTH_GOOGLE_ID production
vercel env add AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET production

# Ship it
vercel --prod
```

After the first deploy, update the Google OAuth redirect URI to your live `*.vercel.app` (or custom) domain.

## Payments — Paymob Integration

Card and mobile wallet payments go through [Paymob](https://accept.paymob.com) (Intention API + Unified Checkout). Cash on Delivery skips this entirely.

- Checkout creates the order, then starts a Paymob payment intention and redirects the customer to Paymob's hosted checkout page.
- Paymob calls back `POST /api/webhooks/paymob?hmac=...` when payment succeeds or fails — the handler verifies the HMAC signature before touching the database (fields/order documented in `lib/paymob.ts`, sourced from Paymob's own official AI-integration reference, not guessed).
- If a customer abandons the Paymob page or the intention fails to create, the order stays `PENDING` and a **"Complete Payment"** button appears on `/orders/[id]` to generate a fresh payment link — Paymob's `client_secret` is single-use.
- Admin's "Mark Payment Paid/Failed" buttons are now a manual override/reconciliation tool (e.g. a webhook got lost), not the primary path.
- This store is Egypt-only for now — the country code sent to Paymob (`EGY`) is hardcoded in `lib/paymob.ts`.

## Shipping — Bosta Integration

Shipments are booked automatically through [Bosta](https://business.bosta.co) instead of manual carrier entry.

- Shipping cost is calculated before checkout via a `ShippingRate` table (per-governorate, admin-managed at `/admin/shipping-rates`). Free shipping over `FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD` EGP (default 3000), shown to the customer on the checkout page.
- Bosta's location model has three real tiers — City → Zone → District — not two. Checkout has three cascading dropdowns (governorate/area/district), all backed by live Bosta data (`/api/bosta/cities`, `/zones`, `/districts`), and the real `districtId` gets cached on the Address/Order so "Ship with Bosta" never has to re-resolve by name.
- Admin clicks **"Ship with Bosta"** on an order → we call `POST https://app.bosta.co/api/v2/deliveries?apiVersion=1` and store the returned `trackingNumber`/`bostaDeliveryId`.
- Register your webhook **once** in the Bosta dashboard (Settings → API Integration → Request OTP → Set Up Your Webhook), not per-delivery: URL `https://<your-domain>/api/webhooks/bosta`, plus a custom Authorization header — set its value to your `BOSTA_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (our handler reads it from the `x-webhook-secret` request header).
- Cancelling an order in the admin also attempts to cancel the Bosta delivery (best-effort — won't block cancellation if Bosta rejects it, e.g. already picked up).
- The delivery address only sends a plain `city` name (e.g. "Cairo") — Bosta validates it server-side and returns a clear error if it doesn't match. For more precise routing you can add `zoneId`/`districtId` in `lib/bosta.ts` once you've downloaded Bosta's zoning sheet (linked from [docs.bosta.co/docs/how-to/format-bosta-address](https://docs.bosta.co/docs/how-to/format-bosta-address)) — not required, `city` alone satisfies their API.

## Known Gotchas (learned the hard way)

- `app/generated/prisma` must be regenerated with `npx prisma generate` any time `app/` is replaced or after a fresh clone.
- Use `AUTH_SECRET` — using `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` causes a persistent `MissingSecret` error.
- `@relation` attributes in `schema.prisma` must stay single-line; multi-line breaks the parser.
- Next.js 16 renamed `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts` with a named `proxy` export (already done here).
- `typedRoutes: false` in `next.config.ts` avoids false-positive type errors on dynamic `href` template literals.
- Prisma 7 does **not** auto-run seeds on `migrate dev`/`migrate deploy` — always run `npx prisma db seed` explicitly.
- **Migration history drift:** `prisma migrate status`/`migrate dev` trust the `_prisma_migrations` table in the real database, not `schema.prisma` directly. If two migration folders end up describing the same schema change, trust whichever one `migrate status` shows as actually recorded/applied in the DB — not whichever has the earlier timestamp in its folder name. Deleting the wrong one produces a drift error whose only offered fix is `migrate reset` (which drops all data) — don't run that; restore the correct migration file instead.
- **Windows PowerShell + `Set-Content -Encoding utf8`** silently prepends a UTF-8 BOM. This breaks Postgres's SQL parser during Prisma's shadow-database migration checks (`syntax error at or near ""`). Use `-Encoding ascii` for pure-ASCII SQL files, or `[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText($path, $content, (New-Object System.Text.UTF8Encoding $false))` for files that need real Unicode characters.
